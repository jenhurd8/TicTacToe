# TicTacToe

One of my first Java projects. A simple single page java program that can be run from the terminal.

Directions to run from git bash or command prompt:
1) Fork repo
2) Change directory in terminal to TicTacToe:
   cd TicTacToe
3) Compile the program by typing:
   javac TicTacToe.java
4) Run the program:
   java Tic
5) Play the game and enjoy!
